# Colors of the Century: Constitution

## Vision

Colors of the Century is a visual exploration of time through color. By transforming dates into colors, we create a unique perspective on the calendar, allowing users to discover patterns and relationships between dates and their visual representations.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: The application should be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean interface that focuses on the visual experience of the calendar.

2. **Accessibility**: The application should be accessible to all users, regardless of device or technical expertise. It should work across platforms and browsers without requiring special installations.

3. **Performance**: The application should be fast and responsive, even when displaying a full year of color-coded days.

4. **Educational Value**: The application should help users understand the relationship between dates and their hexadecimal color representations, encouraging exploration and discovery.

## Design Guidelines

1. **Visual Clarity**: Each day's color should be clearly visible, with sufficient contrast for the date numbers to be readable.

2. **Responsive Layout**: The calendar should adapt to different screen sizes, maintaining usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. **Consistent Interaction**: User interactions should be consistent throughout the application, with clear feedback for actions like selecting a day or changing the year.

4. **Minimalist Aesthetic**: The interface should be clean and uncluttered, allowing the colors of the calendar to be the focal point.

## Technical Standards

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: The application should be built using a component-based architecture for maintainability and reusability.

2. **Client-Side Processing**: All calculations and rendering should happen client-side, without requiring server-side processing.

3. **Modern JavaScript**: The codebase should use modern JavaScript features and best practices, with appropriate polyfills for broader browser compatibility.

4. **CSS Organization**: Styles should be organized by component, with a consistent naming convention and minimal use of global styles.

## Feature Guidelines

1. **Year Selection**: Users should be able to input any year between 0 and 9999, with validation to prevent invalid inputs.

2. **Color Information**: When a user selects a day, the application should display the date and corresponding color code clearly.

3. **Visual Feedback**: The application should provide visual feedback for user interactions, such as hovering over or selecting a day.

4. **Extensibility**: The architecture should allow for future enhancements, such as additional visualization modes or export options.

## Maintenance and Evolution

1. **Documentation**: Code should be well-documented, with clear explanations of components, functions, and design decisions.

2. **Testing**: New features should be thoroughly tested across different browsers and devices before being merged.

3. **Feedback Integration**: User feedback should be regularly collected and integrated into the development roadmap.

4. **Version Control**: All changes should be tracked through version control, with clear commit messages explaining the purpose and impact of each change.

This constitution serves as the guiding document for all development decisions related to the Colors of the Century project. Any significant deviations from these principles should be carefully considered and documented.
